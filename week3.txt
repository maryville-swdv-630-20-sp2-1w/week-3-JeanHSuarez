Answer the following questions:

1. What are the parent and child classes here?

Parent class is Spell and the child classes are Accacio and Confundo

2. What are the base and sub-classes?

Base class is Spell and the sub-classes are Accio and Confundo

3. What is the output from this code?   Try without running if you can

Accio
SummoningCharmAccio No description

4. When study_spell(Confundo()) executes...what get_description method gets called and why?

The method is not called. It raises an error as confundo is not declared. 

5. The statement print Accio() needs to print ‘This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance’)? Write down the code that we need to add and/or change.

def new(self):
print("This charm summons an object to the caster potentially over a significant distance")

spell.new()
